BitCraft BSATN data
-------------------

Like [BitCraft_GameData](https://github.com/BitCraftToolBox/BitCraft_GameData), this repository houses a copy of the static data for BitCraft online.

This repository holds the native binary format of SpacetimeDB, [BSATN](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/bsatn). Use of the [bindings](https://github.com/BitCraftToolBox/BitCraft_Bindings) and their deserialization methods is highly recommended for using these files, unless you are developing a SpacetimeDB SDK in an unsupported language or just like hand decoding binary formats.
